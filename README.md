## [BST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree)

### BST Overview

## [AVL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree)

### AVL Overview

**AVL tree** (named after inventors _**A**delson_-_**V**elsky_ and _**L**andis_) is a self-balancing binary search tree. In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property.

The following example was taken from the *AVL tree* [wiki-page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree).

## [DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)

### DFS Overview

*Depth-first search* (**DFS**) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

The following example was taken from the *Depth-first search* [wiki-page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search).

## [BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)

### BFS Overview

*Breadth-first search* (**BFS**) is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

The following example was taken from the *Breadth-first search* [wiki-page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search).

## [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)

### Dijkstra's Overview

***Dijkstra's algorithm*** to find the shortest path between *a* and *b*. It picks the unvisited vertex with the lowest distance, calculates the distance through it to each unvisited neighbor, and updates the neighbor's distance if smaller.

The following example was taken from the *Dijkstra's algorithm* [wiki-page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm).

## [Bellman-Ford Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm)

### Bellman-Ford Overview

***The Bellmanâ€“Ford*** algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph.

The following example was taken from the *Bellman-Ford algorithm* [wiki-page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm).
